![Animation](https://github.com/FlorianPix/sliced_sphere_animation/blob/master/sphere/output/anim.gif)

This is an animation of a sliced sphere build with Processing.

If you want to tweak the design you can set record to false and play around with it (because it then loops endlessly and doesnt save the frames).

To create a GIF set record to true, and run the pde.

Note: 
convert.bat and gif.bat afterwards remove all unneeded image files.
Remove the del lines from the bat files if you want to keep single frames.

After that convert all the png files to gif with the convert.bat.
After that stitch all the gifs together to one with gif.bat.
